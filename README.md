# UnityMazeGenerator
Converts a 2D image to a 3D maze in Unity.
Requies Pro-Builder!

You can customise the size and height of each tile, the mesh UV's and the floor, wall and ceiling materials.
The output is a pro-builder mesh for each tile but the script can be adapted to generate regular meshes.
